    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there, and a warm welcome to my virtual abode! 
As a postdoctoral researcher in the Stochastics group at Aarhus University, I work on problems at the interface of probability theory, random graph models, and stochastic geometry. My current research explores the behavior of spatially embedded networks governed by Gibbsian interactions, with a focus on understanding their structural and probabilistic properties. A significant part of this work involves the development of large deviation principles for spatial network models and the study of rare events and limiting behavior in such systems.
Alongside my research activities, I am also involved in teaching courses in probability theory and random complex networks, contributing to the graduate-level curriculum within the mathematics department.
I did a PhD in the Mathematics and Computer Science department at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands. As a member of the NETWORKS program, I was affiliated with the Probability group. The title of my PhD thesis was 'Centrality measures and connectivity properties in large networks'. </p>
